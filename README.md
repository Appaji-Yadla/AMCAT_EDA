Exploring Academic Performance: Analyze academic performance metrics, such as 10th and 12th-grade percentages, college GPA, and examine their distributions.

Unveiling Professional Attributes: Investigate key professional attributes like technical skills, cognitive skills, and personality traits.

Testing a Claim: Evaluate the claim made in a Times of India article regarding earnings potential for Computer Science Engineering graduates.

Examining Gender-Specialization Relationship: Explore if there is a significant relationship between gender and specialization preferences.


Demographic Overview:
Although females represent a smaller proportion (23.9%), their academic performance in tenth and twelfth grades is notably high.

Experience Distribution:
Two prominent peaks in experience distribution (0-5 years and 10-15 years) suggest distinct groups in the dataset.

Job Cities Analysis:
Cities like Howrah, Muvattupuzha, Trichur, and others have the lowest average salaries.
Four out of the ten cities with the lowest average salaries are in Kerala.

Specialization Analysis:
Top three specializations based on the highest average salary: Electronics and Communication Engineering, Computer Science & Engineering, and Information Technology.

Gender and Specialization Relationship:
Chi-square test establishes a significant relationship between Gender and Specialization.

Research Hypothesis:
Contrary to the claim, only Programmer Analysts among fresh graduates earn up to 2.5 lakhs.

Experience and Salary Relationship:
Salary is not directly proportional to experience, as evident from the analysis.
